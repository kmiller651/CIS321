page table function conversion:
Separates program into dictionaries of size 4.

Program functions: Spell out sentences in RAM with page table locations/ Changes color of box in page table for in use or not/ updates Output box with text

Ram:
-Array with reserved spaces for page tables, excess can be used to run the program.

Disk:
-Array with free spaces for excess program storage.

Log:
-Shows what programs have been run

Simulation:
1. Virtual Mem populated with letters of program.
2. Page table dictionaries generated with letters and locations.
3. RAM and Disk randomly populated with page tables/letters in program, locations stored in page tables.
4. Program runs, spelling out a sentence in the RAM.
5. Log updates after program finishes.

Virtual Mem = 2D Array (Program length)
Page Table = Dictionary (4 key/value pairs)
RAM = 2D Array (30 arrays  First 4 of each array dedicated for PTE's)
Disk = 2D Array (48 arrays 24 & 24 First 6 of each dedicated for excess PTE's)
Output box = Text
Log = Text

Sentences: "Welcome to Virtual Memory Simulator" 
"Virtual memory is split into page table entries"
"Page table entries track the locations on RAM and the Disk"
"We wish you a Merry Christmas"
