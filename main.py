#Task:
#Create a visualization for swapping programs in and out of memory with the use of the
#‘Virtual Memory’ concept. This should include simulated programs, memory addresses,
#page tables, and optionally the ‘translation lookaside buffer.’ A video showing the
#functionality of the code is required along with the code base itself (no video length is
#specified).
